# hci-finaltest

This is a final test project for the Human-Computer Interaction course. For this project, I was asked to create a web-based prototype (front-end only) for a clinic that wants to have a website for online booking purposes. The website must have the following functions:
<ul>
<li>Registration for new patient</li>
<li>Booking for registered patients</li>
<li>Queue number confirmation</li>
<li>Notification for estimated arrival time</li>
<li>Status of the queue in real-time</li>
</ul>
